# Meteomatic-end-to-end-data-engineering-project
In this project, we will build an ETL pipeline using the METEOMATIC API on AWS and AZURE. I retreive data frim METEOMATIC API, transform it to desired format, and load it an Azure Blob Storage. 

Projet Goals

1. Data Ingestion - Build a mechanism to ingest data from different sources
2. ETL System - We are getting data in raw format, transforming this data into the proper format
3. Datalake - We will be getting data from multiple sources so we need centralized repo to store them
4. Scalability - As the size of our data increases, we need to make sure our sustem scales with it
5. Clud - We can't process vast amounts of data on our local computer so we ned to use the cloud, in this case, we will use Azure Fabric
6. Reporting - Build a dashboard to get answers to the question we asked earlier
